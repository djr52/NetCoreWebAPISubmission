An API for our school may be used to constantly transfer, post, or get student data. Student data may and will include year of graduation, current and total credits earned, current courses, etc. Other school data, such as available courses, will also be utilized within the API. An API would help in the development of creating a LMS for students to use so that they themselves may view their credits, courses, etc. For mobile uses, the app of an LMS can connect and use the schools API so that school and stuff will stay up-to-date on relevant course information, and their current statuses within those courses. A web application will function mostly the same way, except you will be able to actually register to available courses provided by the API. The API will be extendable, and other applications will easily obtained updated data about new/changed courses, or even new Majors. Course Registration will update accordingly to the new data provided by the REST API.

## Hands-On Assignment
Describe how an API for our school will be used to support the schoolâ€™s business operations. The scope of the project is to create a minimally viable product (MVP) of an API that supports online course registration for our school.  Describe the uses of the API such as supporting mobile and web-based course registration as well as supporting other business applications that the school may develop in the future.
